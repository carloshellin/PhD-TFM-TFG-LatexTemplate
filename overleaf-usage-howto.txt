HOWTO: Template usage in overleaf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to work with the template in overleaf, it's pretty easy.

Here you are the main steps:

1. Log in to overleaf
2. In the main page, select the "New Project" button
3. Select "Upload project"
4. Select the corresponding zip among the ones you may find in the
   template dropbox folder
   (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mm6fwh3ruuuyjz2/AABDUmo7Xj1S968FeJgbmFPva?dl=0e)
5. Overleaf will do its magic and in a few seconds you'll have the
   template installed

The next step is configuring your data in the Config/myconfig.tex, and
then you will have to select the "main document" (access it through
the options you will find pressing the overleaf logo in the top left
corner of the project main page).

These are the most relevant ones to select as "main document":

+ Anteproyecto/anteproyecto.tex: to write your anteproyecto...
+ Book/book.tex: to write the Thesis/TFM/TFG report
+ Papeleo/SolicitudTFGTFM/solicitud.tex: to submit along with your
  anteproyecto for it to be evaluated
+ You can also have a llok to the Papeleo subdirs...

Enjoy!
